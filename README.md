# PaintBrush

This is a simple drawing application named "PaintBrush" implemented in Java as an Applet. The project allows users to draw various shapes, including rectangles, ovals, lines, erasers, and freehand pencil sketches. It provides options to choose different colors, fill shapes, use dotted strokes, and undo/redo drawing actions.

## Features

- **Drawing Modes**: Supports multiple drawing modes, including rectangles, ovals, lines, erasers, and freehand pencil sketches.
- **Color Selection**: Users can choose colors for their drawings, including red, green, blue, and black.

- **Dotted Stroke**: Provides the option to draw shapes with a dotted stroke.
- **Undo/Redo**: Allows users to undo and redo drawing actions.
- **Clear All**: Clears the entire canvas.
- **User Interface**: Simple GUI with buttons for different functionalities.

## Usage

1. Choose the desired drawing mode (Rectangle, Oval, Line, Eraser, Pencil) using the corresponding buttons.
2. Select a color (Red, Green, Blue, Black) for drawing.
3. Optionally, enable the fill checkbox to fill shapes with the selected color.
4. Enable the dotted checkbox to draw shapes with a dotted stroke.
