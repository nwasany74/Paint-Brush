Notes
The code uses object-oriented principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
The project is implemented as an Applet with event-driven programming for user interactions.
The drawing application allows for creating and manipulating geometric shapes using Java's graphics capabilities.
Note: Applets are deprecated in modern Java, and this project is presented for educational purposes.
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this drawing application!
